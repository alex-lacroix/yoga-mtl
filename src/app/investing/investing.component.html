    <h2>Why invest in corporate yoga?</h2>
    <h3>
      Our classes can help employees to be more mindful at work and towards your
      clients, as well as improve physical wellness by reducing back, neck and
      shoulder pain and can have a positive effect on reducing employee
      absenteeism. <br />
      Yoga and meditation increases productivity, concentration, creativity and
      performance while reducing stress and anxiety.<br />
      Team building yoga classes improve inter-staff relations and communication
      â€“ increasing employee satisfaction.
